## 1. Introduction

The digital transformation of enterprises and academia has led to an explosion of unstructured documents—PDFs, scanned images, reports, contracts, scientific papers, and more. Extracting structured knowledge from these sources is a grand challenge, with implications for automation, compliance, research, and business intelligence. Traditional keyword search and manual review are insufficient for the scale and complexity of modern document corpora. Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) offer new possibilities, but vanilla LLMs are prone to hallucination and lack grounding in source material. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses these issues by combining information retrieval with generative models, enabling accurate, explainable, and context-aware question answering over documents.

This project aims to build a robust, end-to-end Document Intelligence platform using RAG, capable of parsing, indexing, and answering questions over arbitrary PDF documents. The system is designed for scalability, transparency, and extensibility, leveraging open-source technologies and cloud-native deployment.

## 2. Motivation and Problem Statement

### 2.1 Motivation
- **Information Overload:** Enterprises and researchers are inundated with vast quantities of unstructured documents, making manual review impractical.
- **Inefficiency of Manual Processes:** Human extraction is slow, error-prone, and expensive.
- **Limitations of Traditional Search:** Keyword-based search fails to capture semantic meaning, context, and reasoning.
- **LLM Hallucination:** Large language models, while powerful, can generate plausible-sounding but incorrect answers when not grounded in source data.
- **Need for Explainability:** Regulatory and business requirements demand transparent, auditable AI systems.

### 2.2 Problem Statement
To design and implement a scalable, explainable, and accurate system that enables users to query unstructured PDF documents in natural language and receive grounded, evidence-backed answers, with supporting context and traceability.

## Update: Context-Aware Q&A Enhancement

### Multi-Turn, Context-Aware Question Answering

A major enhancement was introduced to the system: **Context-Aware Answer Generation**. This upgrade enables the platform to leverage the entire conversation history (user questions and assistant answers) for more coherent, contextually relevant, and natural multi-turn dialogues. The following describes the update and its impact:

#### 1. Motivation
- Many real-world information-seeking tasks involve follow-up questions that depend on previous answers.
- Context-aware Q&A allows the system to resolve pronouns, references, and maintain conversational flow.

#### 2. Implementation
- A new `ContextAwareAnswerGenerator` class wraps the core answer generator.
- The Streamlit app now stores the full chat history in `st.session_state.chat_history`.
- For each new question, the system:
    - Appends the question to the chat history.
    - Builds a contextual prompt summarizing the last several Q&A exchanges.
    - Passes this prompt to the answer generator, allowing the LLM to consider prior context.
    - Appends the assistant's answer to the chat history.

#### 3. Technical Details
- The context window is limited to the last 4 exchanges for efficiency.
- The prompt is dynamically constructed as:
    ```
    Based on our conversation so far:
    You were asked: '...'
    You answered: '...'
    ...
    Now answer this follow-up question: <current question>
    ```
- The system falls back to single-turn QA if there is no prior context.

#### 4. Benefits
- Enables follow-up and clarification questions.
- Reduces ambiguity by grounding answers in the conversation.
- Improves user experience and answer accuracy in multi-turn scenarios.

#### 5. Example
- **User:** What is the net profit in Q2?
- **Assistant:** The net profit in Q2 was $1.2M. [evidence]
- **User:** How does that compare to Q1?
- **Assistant:** The net profit in Q2 ($1.2M) increased by 10% compared to Q1 ($1.09M). [evidence]

#### 6. Code Reference
- See `app.py` for the implementation of `ContextAwareAnswerGenerator` and session state management.
